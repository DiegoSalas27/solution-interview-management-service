# Interview Management Service

The interview Manager Service uses LLM models from Open API GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.x to initiate interviews leveraging configuration inputs received via API calls that dictate which model to use. Client responses include meta-data used internally to perform health checks on LLMs and switch to secondary LLMs which are available and are expected to have lower latency.
